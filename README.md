# Hi, I’m Varsha 👩🏻‍💻
I’m not a traditional techie.
I started not with computers, but with curiosity — the kind that asks “what if?” instead of “what now?”
As a child, I played with magnets and wires.
As a teen, I explored why people get hacked.
Now, I’m on a mission to build tools that protect, empower, and inspire.
I blend:
💻 Technology
🧠 Psychology
🔐 Cybersecurity
🎨 Storytelling
